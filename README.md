This is the official repo for the Petnica Summer Institute Summer School on Machine Learning for Scientific Research. The summer school aims to equip participants with an in-depth knowledge of machine learning approaches and to inspire their application in scientific research. To this end, we will offer intensive and thorough courses on fundamental and applied facets of machine learning. Namely, we aim to present how and why techniques work in a specific scientific context.

## topics
- Deep Learning
- Transformers
- Reinforcement Learning
- Self-Supervised Learning
- Physics-informed neural networks
- Bayesian Networks
- Normalizing Flows
With the applications including, but not limited to: Computer Vision, Signal Processing, Hydrodynamics, Genetics, Cybersecurity, Linguistics, Astrophysics / Cosmology, etc.
